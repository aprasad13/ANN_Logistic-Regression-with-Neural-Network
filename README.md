# Logistic-Regression-with-Neural-Network

## Overview of the Problem set
<strong> Problem Statement: </strong> We are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:

- a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
- a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).

I have built a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
